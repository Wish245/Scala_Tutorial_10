1. Write a Scala function called calculateAverage that takes a list of temperatures as 
input and uses the map function to convert each temperature to Fahrenheit, and then 
uses the reduce function to calculate the average Fahrenheit temperature. The 
formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: (C * 9/5) + 32.
Example:
Input: [0, 10, 20, 30]
Output: Average Fahrenheit temperature: 68.0
Implement the calculateAverage function using the map and reduce methods.
2. Write a Scala function called countLetterOccurrences that takes a list of words as 
input and uses the map function to transform the words into their respective lengths 
(number of letters), and then uses the reduce function to calculate the total count of 
letter occurrences in all the words combined.
Example:
Input: ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
Output: Total count of letter occurrences: 24
Implement the countLetterOccurrences function using the map and reduce methods
